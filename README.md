# What is 'Smart Random Build Generator' and Why should I use It?

**Smart Random Build Generator** (SRBG) is a user-friendly tool for **Dead by Daylight** game that can be used to:
* **generate useful random builds** using varied features
* **store and manipulate builds** (5000+ predefined builds loaded at start)

Most related tools generate pure random builds which are hardly ever interesting/efficient because lots of perks are either trash or just incompatible.


By contrast, **SRBG** will create **useful random builds** if desired:

**Widget feature is also available for more convenient use of SRBG within the game**

**SRBG** can randomly chose the **side** ('**_Survivor_**' or '**_Killer_**') for your next game

Both '**_number of perks in each build_**' and the '**_number of builds to generate_**' can be **fine tuned**

Briefly, a **weight** is assigned to each **perk**, and random builds are subsequently designed with **bias toward perks with higher weights**

### Interesting features can also be enabled on both sides:
* **perk constraints** (required perk from varied classes, see below)
* **perk-based synergy rules**
* **character-based synergy rules**

<u>**Example of Perk Constraints for Survivor Side**</u>:

* <u>Set 1</u>: perks related to **healing**

* <u>Set 2</u>: perks to increase **survival**

* <u>Set 3</u>: perks to help during **chases**

* <u>Set 4</u>: perks to reveal ** killer or environment auras**

<u>**Example of Perk Constraints for Killer Side**</u>:

* <u>Set 1</u>: perks to **slow-down** the game

* <u>Set 2</u>: perks to help during **chases**

* <u>Set 3</u>: perks to **detect** survivors

* <u>Set 4</u>: perks to have some **advantage during late game**

<u>**Example of Perk-based Synergy Rules**</u>:

* **Favorable synergy rule on survivor side**

* **Unfavorable synergy rule on survivor side**

* ** Favorable synergy rule on killer side**
![SRBG](dbd/data/tuto_files/tuto_syn_p3.png)

* **Unfavorable synergy rule on killer side**

#### The goal of **perk constraints** and **synergy rules** is to generate even **better random builds**

There are no **survivor-based synergy rules** because **survivors are just skins :)**


**It is also possible to generate pure random builds by disabling all these previous features**:

**User-defined configuration files for perk weights, perk sets, synergy rules and build database can also be loaded at start**


**Generated builds** can be easily **saved in a build database** for future use

Finally, a **built-in tutorial** is also included in **SRBG**
