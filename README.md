# What is "Smart Random Build Generator" ?

**Smart Random Build Generator** (SRBG) is a user-friendly tool that can be used to generate random builds for **Dead by Daylight**.

Most related tools purely generate random builds which are hardly ever interesting/efficient because lots of perks are more or less trash in this game.

By contrast, **SRBG** will create good random builds if desired.
Briefly, identical or user-defined weights are assigned to each perk.
Random builds are subsequently designed with bias toward perks with higher weights.

Both sides (survivor and killer) are obviously handled ... and **SRBG** can also chose the side for your next game ;)

Both "number of builds to generate" and "number of perks in each build" can be easily fine tuned.

Finally, some interesting constraints can be enabled:
* required perk related to care/healing (Self-Care, AfterCare, Bond, Pharmacy)
* required sprint perk (Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Lithe, Sprint Burst)
